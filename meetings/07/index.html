    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/tallinn-postgresql-meetup/events/297382229/" title="Meetup.com event link">Meetup #7</a> was hosted by <a href="https://codeborne.com/en/" target="_blank">Codeborne</a> in Ülemiste City.
</p>

<p>
    We had about 30 people attending, unfortunately a lot of people who initially wanted to
    attend had to cancel admission because of flu-season, and even among attending ones
    there was some coughing :(. We really hope that on our next event we all will be
    healthy. We had 2 presentations and tiny lightning talk:
</p>

<ul>
<li>"Lessons learned in using Postgres in real-life projects" - by Erik Jõgi, founder of Codeborne<br/>
    Key takeaway: Database tests can be both fast and simple, but there are rules to follow.</li>
<li>little lightning talk:  "Socratic questions about your database" - by Ervin Weber<br/>
    Key takeaway: none, there was no answers, just a few unanswered questions, that are worth thinking about. Maybe.
</li>
<li>"Generating test data with Postgres" - by Kaarel Moppel, Principal Database Reliability Engineer at Cognite<br/>
    Key takeaway: PostgreSQL can be both fast and powerful enough to provide you with synthetic data you need.

</ul>

<p>
By the way: a great resource for ideas (and learning) is the PostgreSQL Wiki with it's <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Related_Slides_and_Presentations">"Presentations" section</a>.
